# Better_RainbowCat
Here is a next-gen version of Rainbow Cat that is written in Rust. See README for more info.

Rainbow Cat has a flaw that is quite common in modern software. That is that it uses "RGB" coloring schemes. The problem with this way of coloring is that it has terrible compatibility across diverse systems. The way of web development thinking doesn't work well when applied to all domains. This method uses classic ansi codes to achieve a similar effect. If you want it to look exactly like the original concept, tailor the code as you see fit. Have fun. -ST
