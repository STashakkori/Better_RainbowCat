# Better_RainbowCat
Here is a next-gen version of Rainbow Cat that is written in Rust. See README for more info.

Many colorful console programs uses"RGB" coloring schemes which ends up requiring more color varieties than most terminal emulators can properly account for. Web browsers don't have this problem, hence why this style has become quite common. The issue with the RGB, multiplicative way of coloring is that it sacrifices compatibility across diverse systems. By sticking to standard ansi 256 colors, we can have our fun wherever we want. If you want it to look exactly like the original concept, tailor the code as you see fit. I didn't write the sine wave functionality I hardcoded what you see. But realize unless you add colors that are likely only supported by a small subset of hardware/software combinations, you can't make the color transitions as smooth as the original
