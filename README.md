# Better_RainbowCat
Here is a next-gen version of Rainbow Cat that is written in Rust. See README for more info.

Many colorful console programs uses"RGB" coloring schemes. The problem with this way of coloring is that it sacrifices compatibility across diverse systems. By sticking to standard ansi 256 colors, we can have our fun wherever we want. If you want it to look exactly like the original concept, tailor the code as you see fit. I didn't write the sine wave functionality I hardcoded what you see. Cheers. -ST
